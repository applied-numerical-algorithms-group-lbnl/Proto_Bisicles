# Proto_Bisicles
* AMR Ice sheet code ported to the device using the Proto infrastructure
* BISICLES is an adaptive mesh ice sheet model.
* This particular variant is being used to develop a proto-based ice sheet solver
and, as such, will be a frozen version of the ice sheet solver except for a few,
well-identified locations.
