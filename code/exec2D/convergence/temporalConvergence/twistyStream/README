This directory contains an implementation of both temporal and spatial convergence tests for the "twistyStream" example, which is described in Cornford et al (JCP, 2013).

If you go to the "setup" directory and invoke the "init_twistystream.sh",
you'll generate a set of inputs files for doing various convergence studies
essentially, it loops over 32x32, 64x64, 128x128 up to 2048x2048 to do
spatial convergence (you might want to edit the shell script to reduce down
to a single resolution)

Then the doRuns-* scripts orchestrate various convergence studies: At the
moment, I've turned off AMR, since it's not really an issue right now.
doRuns.single manages a spatial convergence study, running a set of
different-resolution runs at the same CFL number.  For our situation,
doRuns-<N>.single orchestrates a simple temporal convergence study for
the NxN case, with dt, dt/2, dt/4, and dt/8. (edited) 

Finally, evaluating convergence will be a lot easier using our ChomboCompare
utility, which reads in two Chombo hdf5 plotfiles , subtracts them, and
reports L1, L2, and maxNorm of the difference.

1. Go to Chombo/lib/util/ChomboCompare and build ChomboCompare.

2. Then go to the ChomboCompare/chdiff/ directory and follow the directions
for setting up the "chdiff" utility.

3. Since we're looking at same-resolution plotfiles, the chdiff utility
will make it easy  to simply "diff" two plotfiles to get the norm of the
difference for evaluating convergence -- if you've got "chdiff" in your
path, then just typing

chdiff <file1> <file2>

will subtract file2 from file1 (assuming they're defined on the same
grids/domains) and write out the norms of the difference (if you've
built with MPI, then the norms will appear in the pout file  (pout.0). It will also write a plotfile showing the difference in diff.hdf5.

For spatial convergence, you need to put together appropriate inputs files
to tell ChomboCompare how to do the comparisons.
